# Trumpy News
A simple flask app that combines Tump's tweets and related CNN articles.

## The differential
I decided to do some sentiment analysis on the messages. I used the [nltk](http://www.nltk.org/index.html) library developed by Bird, Steven, Edward Loper and Ewan Klein (2009), Natural Language Processing with Python. Oâ€™Reilly Media Inc.

On the left of the card, it is shown the source of that information, whether its from Twitter or CNN. If the model finds it to be negative sentences on average, it's backgound turns red. If positive, green. Neutrals are blank.

## Configuring:
_This is assuming that you're using bash_

1. Make yourself a virtual environment:
```sh
python -m venv .venv
```
Enter it:
```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install pip requirements:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Add the environment variables:
   
   There are 4 variables required to access twitter and one for flask:
    - CKEY
        Consumer Key
    - CSECRET
        Consumer Secret
    - ATOKEN
        Authentication Token
    - TSECRET
        Token Secret
    - FLASK\_APP
        Required by Flask
        
_You have to get them from https://developer.twitter.com/_
    
```sh
export -x FLASK_APP=main.py
export -x CKEY=XX
export -x CSECRET=XX
export -x ATOKEN=XX
export -x TSECRET=XX
```

3. That's it.

   Running it:
   ```sh
   gunicorn wsgi
   ```

4. Runtime Configurations

   Let's say you want to tune it a bit, there are a few things that come to mind:

    - cnn.py
      The constructor has the following signature:
      ```python
          def __init__(self, article_class, feeds = [], search_terms = []):
      ```
      `feeds` is a optional list of RSS urls that are added to the pre-select 3 cnn sources.
  
      `search_terms` is another optional argument, takes in strings that, if found in the title or summary, considers the article as related to Trump.
  
  
    - twitter.py
      ```python
          def __init__(self, article_class, twitter_account = 25073877):
      ```
      The optional argument **twitter_account** is the twitter id of the desired user whose tweets will be queried. Defaults to @realDonaldtrump.
